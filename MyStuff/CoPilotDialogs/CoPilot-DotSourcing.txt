here is a portion of a script that invokes another script.
$parameters = @{
            Filepath     = "conhost.exe"
            ArgumentList = "pwsh $($noexits) -noprofile -command & {. '$runThisScript' -Filename $arg -SourceDir $SourceDir -DestinationDir $DestinationDir -Priority}"
        }
        "Using these parameters"
        $parameters | format-list *
        # read-host "pause"
        start-process @parameters
It invokes pwsh in the conhost.exe rather than in windows terminal. But why is the  '.' required preceding '$runthisScript'
Copilot said
The dot . preceding $runThisScript in the command & {. '$runThisScript' ...} is known as dot-sourcing in PowerShell. When you dot-source a script, it runs the script in the current scope rather than in a new scope.

Without dot-sourcing, when you run a script, any functions, variables, and aliases defined in the script are only available in the scope of that script. Once the script finishes executing, those definitions are removed from memory. Dot-sourcing changes this behavior by running the script in the current scope, so any functions, variables, and aliases defined in the script remain available after the script finishes executing.

So in this case, dot-sourcing ensures that the script $runThisScript is executed in the current scope, allowing any variables, functions, or other items defined in the script to be used by the current script.

Here's a brief example to illustrate the concept:

powershell

Copy
# Sample script: myScript.ps1
$variable = "Hello, world!"
function Say-Hello {
    Write-Output "Hello!"
}
Without dot-sourcing:

powershell

Copy
& .\myScript.ps1
# The variable and function defined in the script are not available here.
With dot-sourcing:

powershell

Copy
. .\myScript.ps1
# The variable and function defined in the script are available here.
Write-Output $variable  # Outputs: Hello, world!
Say-Hello              # Outputs: Hello!
Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to explore!





You said
What would happen if I removed the '.'?
Copilot said
If you remove the . before $runThisScript, the script will not be dot-sourced and will execute in a new scope. This means that any variables, functions, or aliases defined in $runThisScript will only be available within the scope of that script and will not be accessible in the calling script after $runThisScript finishes executing.

Hereâ€™s what will happen without the dot-sourcing:

The script $runThisScript runs in its own scope.

Any functions, variables, or other items defined in $runThisScript are confined to the scope of that script.

Once $runThisScript completes, those items are discarded and are not available in the calling script.

To illustrate with an example, consider the following:

myScript.ps1:

powershell

Copy
$variable = "Hello, world!"
function Say-Hello {
    Write-Output "Hello!"
}
Main Script without Dot-Sourcing:

powershell

Copy
& .\myScript.ps1
# The variable and function defined in myScript.ps1 are not available here.
Write-Output $variable  # This will cause an error: $variable is not recognized.
Say-Hello              # This will cause an error: The term 'Say-Hello' is not recognized.
So, for your specific case, if you remove the . preceding $runThisScript, any definitions made within $runThisScript will not be accessible once the script completes.

Let me know if you have any other questions or need further clarification!





You said
OK. I understand. However, my intension is to launch it in a new scope. In the example I am launching it in a new instance of PWSH. The thing is, if I remove the '.' I get an error message. It complains about -File. It no longer considers it a parameter $runthisscript. Why is that?
Copilot said
Great question! When you remove the . from the script invocation, it changes how PowerShell interprets the command. This can lead to the error you're encountering with the -File parameter.

In PowerShell, when you use & {. '$runThisScript' ...}, the & operator is used to call a command or script, and the {} braces are used to define a script block. Dot-sourcing the script within the braces ensures that the script runs in the current scope, as we discussed earlier. This setup also correctly interprets the parameters passed to $runThisScript.

However, when you remove the . and try to run $runThisScript directly, PowerShell attempts to invoke $runThisScript as an executable file. It fails to interpret the parameters correctly because it's not being called within a script block. This leads to the error about the -File parameter.

To run the script in a new scope without dot-sourcing, you should directly call the script with the powershell.exe or pwsh executable and pass the script and its parameters as arguments. For example:

powershell

Copy
$runThisScript = "C:\path\to\your\script.ps1"
$arg = "someArgument"
$SourceDir = "C:\source\directory"
$DestinationDir = "C:\destination\directory"
$parameters = @{
    FilePath     = "pwsh"
    ArgumentList = "-noprofile -command & '$runThisScript' -Filename $arg -SourceDir $SourceDir -DestinationDir $DestinationDir -Priority"
}
"Using these parameters"
$parameters | format-list *
start-process @parameters
In this setup, you call pwsh and pass the script and its parameters within the -command argument. This way, the script runs in a new scope, and PowerShell correctly interprets the parameters.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need more assistance.





You said
but all you did was remove the braces {}
Copilot said
You're right, and I see how that could be confusing. The key difference here is how we pass the script and its parameters to pwsh.

When using braces {}, they create a script block that PowerShell can execute within the current scope. When you use dot-sourcing with braces, it ensures that the script runs in the current scope, which isn't what you want.

Instead, to run the script in a new scope without dot-sourcing, you need to directly call the script with pwsh and pass the parameters correctly. Here's the corrected approach:

powershell

Copy
$runThisScript = "C:\path\to\your\script.ps1"
$arg = "someArgument"
$SourceDir = "C:\source\directory"
$DestinationDir = "C:\destination\directory"
$parameters = @{
    FilePath     = "pwsh"
    ArgumentList = "-noprofile -command . '$runThisScript' -Filename $arg -SourceDir $SourceDir -DestinationDir $DestinationDir -Priority"
}
"Using these parameters"
$parameters | format-list *
start-process @parameters
In this setup, pwsh is called with the -command argument, and the script $runThisScript is executed with the parameters directly. This ensures that the script runs in a new instance of PowerShell and the parameters are correctly interpreted.

So, to clarify:

Braces {} create a script block.

Dot-sourcing . ensures execution in the current scope.

Direct invocation without dot-sourcing calls the script in a new scope.

I hope this clears things up! Let me know if you have any further questions or need more details.





You said
but in your example you still have the '.'
Copilot said
You're correct. My apologies for the confusion. Let's try to launch your script without the dot-sourcing.

Hereâ€™s how you can update your script to invoke the PowerShell script in a new instance without using the dot:

powershell

Copy
$runThisScript = "C:\path\to\your\script.ps1"
$arg = "someArgument"
$SourceDir = "C:\source\directory"
$DestinationDir = "C:\destination\directory"
$parameters = @{
    FilePath     = "pwsh"
    ArgumentList = "-noprofile -command `& '$runThisScript' -Filename $arg -SourceDir $SourceDir -DestinationDir $DestinationDir -Priority"
}
"Using these parameters"
$parameters | format-list *
start-process @parameters
In this example, I've removed the dot before $runThisScript and instead used the backtick character ` to correctly escape the & (call operator) so that the script and its parameters are interpreted correctly.

By using the & operator without the dot and ensuring it's properly escaped, we can run the script in a new instance of PowerShell without encountering errors related to the -File parameter.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.





You said
OK .

If there's anything else on your mindâ€”whether it's more scripting queries, something totally unrelated, or just a casual chatâ€”I'm all ears!





You said
wait.  I changed my script to this:
$parameters = @{
            Filepath     = "conhost.exe"
            ArgumentList = "pwsh $($noexits) -noprofile -command `&  '$runThisScript' -Filename $arg -SourceDir $SourceDir -DestinationDir $DestinationDir -Priority"
        }
        "Using these parameters"
        $parameters | format-list *
        # read-host "pause"
        start-process @parameters
And it works fine. It invokes a new instance of pwsh inside of conhost.exe rather than 'windows terminal' and the arguments are passed to '$runThisScript'.  I am not sourcing the file. But I still don't understand why with the braces it has to be dot sourced.
Copilot said
I see what you mean. The key lies in how PowerShell interprets different types of command invocations and scopes. The need for dot-sourcing arises because of how PowerShell handles script blocks and scopes.

Here's a breakdown:

Using Braces {}: When you wrap the command in braces {}, you're creating a script block. Script blocks are pieces of code that can be executed. When you run a script block with &, it's run in the current scope unless you explicitly dot-source it.

Dot-Sourcing .: Dot-sourcing a script block (or a script) runs it in the current scope. This means any changes, variables, or functions defined within the script block persist after the block is executed.

Without Dot-Sourcing: If you don't dot-source a script or script block, it runs in its own scope. Any variables or functions it defines are not available outside of that scope.

To understand why removing the . causes an error, let's take a look at your script invocation without braces:

powershell

Copy
$parameters = @{
    Filepath     = "conhost.exe"
    ArgumentList = "pwsh $($noexits) -noprofile -command `&  '$runThisScript' -Filename $arg -SourceDir $SourceDir -DestinationDir $DestinationDir -Priority"
}
"Using these parameters"
$parameters | format-list *
start-process @parameters
In this version, you're invoking pwsh with the -command argument, which runs the command directly in a new instance of PowerShell. The backtick () is used to escape the&` operator, allowing PowerShell to interpret it correctly.

However, when you use braces and don't dot-source, the command within the braces is executed in a new scope, which causes PowerShell to misinterpret the -File parameter. This is because the script block { '$runThisScript' -Filename $arg ... } is evaluated in a different way, causing it to lose context unless dot-sourced.

Hereâ€™s a visual representation:

With Dot-Sourcing and Braces:

powershell

Copy
& {. '$runThisScript' -Filename $arg -SourceDir $SourceDir -DestinationDir $DestinationDir -Priority }
Without Dot-Sourcing and Direct Invocation:

powershell

Copy
pwsh -noprofile -command `& '$runThisScript' -Filename $arg -SourceDir $SourceDir -DestinationDir $DestinationDir -Priority
To summarize, the braces create a script block, which needs to be dot-sourced to keep the current context and correctly interpret the parameters. When you remove the braces and call the script directly, it runs in a new instance and interprets the parameters as expected.

I hope this clears up the confusion! Feel free to ask if you need further clarification or have any more questions. ðŸ˜Š





You said
I am going to read this a few times. But I think I understand. In the case with the braces I am dot sourcing a script block.
Copilot said
Exactly! Youâ€™ve got it. In the case with the braces {}, you're creating a script block, and when you use the dot (.), you're dot-sourcing that script block to execute it within the current scope. This allows any variables, functions, or changes made within the script block to persist in the calling scope.

When you don't use the dot (.), the script block runs in its own scope, and any changes are discarded after the block finishes executing.

It sounds like you have a solid grasp on the concept. If you have any more questions or need further clarification as you read through it, feel free to reach out. I'm here to help! ðŸ˜Š
