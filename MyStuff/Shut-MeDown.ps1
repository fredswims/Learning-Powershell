Yes—Windows 11 uses a feature called Fast Startup, which performs a hybrid shutdown. 
To force a full restart on next boot, you can either disable Fast Startup or use a command-line shutdown that bypasses it.

Here’s how to do both:

What Fast Startup Does

Fast Startup saves the system state (kernel + drivers) to hiberfil.sys during shutdown.

On next boot, Windows resumes from this saved state—not a full cold boot.

This speeds up startup but can cause issues with drivers, firmware, or updates that expect a clean boot.

Option 1: Disable Fast Startup (Permanent Full Shutdowns)

Open Control Panel → System and Security → Power Options.

Click “Choose what the power buttons do”.

Click “Change settings that are currently unavailable”.

Uncheck “Turn on fast startup (recommended)”.

Save changes.

This ensures every shutdown is a full shutdown, but it affects all future shutdowns.

Option 2: Force Full Shutdown via Command Line (One-Time)

Use this command to bypass Fast Startup for a single shutdown:

shutdown /s /f /t 0

/s = shutdown

/f = force close apps

/t 0 = no delay

This performs a true shutdown, and the next boot will be a full restart.

Option 3: Use Restart Instead of Shutdown

If you want a clean reboot without disabling Fast Startup:

shutdown /r /f /t 0

This forces a full restart immediately, skipping Fast Startup entirely.

Bonus: Sleep Study & Modern Standby

Some devices use Modern Standby, which can mimic shutdown but keep power states active. You can run:

powercfg /sleepstudy

to audit whether your system is truly powering off.

Check Boot Type via PowerShell

To determine whether the last boot was a 
full shutdown, fast startup, or hibernation, run this PowerShell command:

Get-WinEvent -ProviderName Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Boot -MaxEvents 10 | Where-Object { $_.Id -eq 27 } | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Message

Look for a line like:

The boot type was 0x1

Then match it to this table:

Boot Type Code

Meaning

0x0

Cold boot (full shutdown)

0x1

Fast startup (hybrid boot)

0x2

Resume from hibernation

Let me know if you want to integrate this check into a startup script or log it for diagnostics.
