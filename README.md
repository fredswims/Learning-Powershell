# Learning-Powershell
This is a repository for all my Powershell scripts. It is a mixture of borrowed scripts and original scripts. In most instances I have credited the original author(s).


1. The **root directory** of your project is typically the directory that contains the `.git` folder, which represents your Git repository. This is the base folder where Git stores all its version control information.

2. The `.vscode` folder is usually located in the same root directory as well. This folder contains Visual Studio Code's workspace-specific settings, tasks, or debugger configurations for the project.

3. If your `.git` and `.vscode` folders exist in the same directory, then that directory is your project root. 

4. If you're working in a subdirectory within the project, Git and VS Code will still refer to the root directory for version control and workspace settings.

5. Place the .gitignore file here.
